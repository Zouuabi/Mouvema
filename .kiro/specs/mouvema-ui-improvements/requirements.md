# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on comprehensive UI/UX improvements for the Mouvema Flutter application, addressing critical user experience issues in authentication, load posting, and map visualization. The improvements will modernize the interface, enhance usability, and add essential functionality for better user engagement.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Authentication System Redesign

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean and intuitive authentication experience without social login clutter, so that I can quickly and securely access the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the login screen THEN the system SHALL display only email/password authentication options
2. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages (invalid email format, wrong password, account not found)
3. WHEN a user attempts to register with an existing email THEN the system SHALL display "Email already registered" error
4. WHEN a user enters a weak password THEN the system SHALL display password strength requirements
5. WHEN authentication fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL display "Connection error, please try again" message
6. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL navigate to the main screen within 2 seconds
7. WHEN a user views the authentication screens THEN the system SHALL display a modern, consistent design with proper spacing and typography

### Requirement 1.1: Registration Flow Simplification

**User Story:** As a user, I want a streamlined registration process without unnecessary steps, so that I can quickly create an account and start using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts the registration process THEN the system SHALL NOT include a phone number collection step
2. WHEN a user completes registration THEN the system SHALL only require user type, username, birth date, email, and password
3. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL integrate properly with Firebase Authentication without conflicts
4. WHEN registration form fields are displayed THEN the system SHALL use separate text field widgets for login and register to avoid error handling conflicts
5. WHEN a user interacts with registration fields THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent UI appearance with login fields but use independent validation logic
6. WHEN Firebase account creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL properly save user profile data without phone number requirement
7. WHEN registration validation occurs THEN the system SHALL not validate or require phone number input

### Requirement 2: Post Load Screen Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive and visually appealing interface for posting loads with reliable map functionality, so that I can efficiently create load postings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the post load screen THEN the system SHALL display a modern, card-based layout with clear visual hierarchy
2. WHEN a user taps the map selection area THEN the system SHALL open a full-screen map with smooth animations
3. WHEN a user selects origin and destination on the map THEN the system SHALL display location names using reverse geocoding
4. WHEN reverse geocoding fails THEN the system SHALL display coordinates as fallback with retry option
5. WHEN a user long-presses on the map THEN the system SHALL place markers with distinct colors (green for origin, red for destination)
6. WHEN a user taps an existing marker THEN the system SHALL allow marker removal or repositioning
7. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight invalid fields with specific error messages
8. WHEN a load is successfully posted THEN the system SHALL show success feedback and return to main screen

### Requirement 3: OSM Integration and Geocoding Improvements

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable map functionality with accurate location names, so that I can confidently select pickup and delivery locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the map loads THEN the system SHALL use OpenStreetMap tiles with proper attribution
2. WHEN a user searches for a location THEN the system SHALL provide autocomplete suggestions using Nominatim API
3. WHEN a user selects coordinates THEN the system SHALL perform reverse geocoding to display readable addresses
4. WHEN geocoding requests fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
5. WHEN the device is offline THEN the system SHALL display cached map tiles and show offline indicator
6. WHEN GPS location is requested THEN the system SHALL handle permissions gracefully with user-friendly messages
7. WHEN map interactions occur THEN the system SHALL provide smooth zoom and pan animations

### Requirement 4: Map View with Load Clustering

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view all available loads on a map with intelligent clustering, so that I can easily discover opportunities in different areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the map view THEN the system SHALL display all loads as markers on an interactive map
2. WHEN multiple loads are close together THEN the system SHALL group them into clusters showing the count
3. WHEN a user zooms in THEN the system SHALL split clusters into individual markers or smaller clusters
4. WHEN a user zooms out THEN the system SHALL merge nearby markers into larger clusters
5. WHEN a user taps a cluster THEN the system SHALL zoom in to show individual markers or expand the cluster
6. WHEN a user taps an individual marker THEN the system SHALL display load details in a bottom sheet
7. WHEN the map view loads THEN the system SHALL center on the user's location or last viewed area
8. WHEN load data updates THEN the system SHALL refresh markers without disrupting the current map view

### Requirement 5: Consistent Design System

**User Story:** As a user, I want a cohesive visual experience throughout the application, so that the interface feels professional and easy to navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any screen loads THEN the system SHALL use consistent color scheme, typography, and spacing
2. WHEN interactive elements are displayed THEN the system SHALL follow Material Design 3 guidelines
3. WHEN forms are presented THEN the system SHALL use consistent input field styling and validation feedback
4. WHEN loading states occur THEN the system SHALL display consistent progress indicators
5. WHEN errors are shown THEN the system SHALL use standardized error message styling and positioning
6. WHEN buttons are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent sizing, padding, and visual hierarchy
7. WHEN animations are used THEN the system SHALL ensure smooth 60fps performance on target devices

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when things go wrong and guidance on how to resolve issues, so that I can successfully complete my tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with retry options
2. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic fields with specific guidance
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages without exposing security details
4. WHEN map operations fail THEN the system SHALL offer alternative actions or fallback functionality
5. WHEN the app crashes THEN the system SHALL log errors for debugging while showing graceful error screens to users
6. WHEN operations succeed THEN the system SHALL provide positive feedback through animations or messages
7. WHEN loading takes longer than 3 seconds THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators with estimated completion time
